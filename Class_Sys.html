Prokaryota are commonly single-celled organisms, and they lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Here is the phylum:
-Archaea. Despite a morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably for the enzymes involved in transcription and translation.
-Bacteria. The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane, which is made primarily of phospholipids. This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell.

Eukarya are organisms whose cells have a membrane-bound nucleus. Here is the phylum:
-Protista. A protist or protoctist is any eukaryotic organism that is not an animal, plant, or fungus. Protists do not form a natural group, or clade, but an artificial grouping of several independent clades that evolved from the last eukaryotic common ancestor.
-Plantae. Plantae have cells with cellulose in their cell walls, and primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria that contain chlorophylls a and b and lack phycobilins
-Fungi. A characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Fungi, like animals, are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesize.
-Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development.

Synthera are organisms who do not possess cells and are commonly created through artificial means, androids and ai are common examples. Here are the phylum:
-Androidia. An artificial being or a cybernetic organism, particularly one that replicates human intelligence and behavior, comprised of, or primarily of microchips, metals or similar synthetic materials, with some exceptions. Androids are separated from other phylum by their motility, intelligence and mimicry of Eukaryotic organisms of the Animalia phylum. Androids usually have internal power supplies, with modes of obtaining power either being via connecting to an external power source, or using an internal system to convert energies into a usable format.
-Asynthera. Asynthera are distinguished from other Synthera by the lack of control over their mechanical systems, usually being composed of large computer servers and possessing large amounts of intelligence. Asynths commonly have power supplied to them through external means.
-Fabrilie. Fabrilie are distinguished from other phylum of synthera by their lack of physical origin of sentience, rather they are composed of an object or host that has been inhabited by structured magical energy, although the magical energy can form into an organism if the energies are strong or structured enough.

With all of these phylum and dominions there are possible beings comprised of half of one type of synthera and half of or multiple of another phylum or dominion, these are considered two separate organisms, even if they are unable to survive and reproduce without one another, this is seen in both cyborgs and object heads, taking both these examples into account, a component of this being is only considered a separate organism if it cannot be removed without compromising that beings ability to live. Taking the cyborg example, this being would be comprised of two organisms only if the synthera, which would be considered phylum androdia replaces enough of the base creature that the creature can no longer function if these parts were removed, otherwise the cybernetic additions to the body of the organism are simply prosthetics and not considered a separate organism. As with the object head, it would be comprised of a fabrilie (the head) and a animalia (the body), these are considered two separate organisms because the base body would be fully functional if the object were to be removed, and the object would in most cases retain all non-physical capabilities, and do not usually die.
